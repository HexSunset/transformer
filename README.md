# Transformer
Tool for transforming different algebraic expressions.

## Feature goals
- [ ] A way to represent different values mathematically accurately. As a product of different elements so `2 * sqrt(2)` would not be approximated to ~2.828427...
- [ ] A function to get the approximate numeric value of one of these mathematical values.
- [ ] A way to represent members with variables or unknowns in them.
- [ ] A way to create and apply transformation rules for different expressions.
- [ ] Macros to easily create and work with expressions and rules.
- [ ] A Cli interface.
- [ ] "Primitive" built-in functions like sqrt, sin, cos etc. That can be used in values and expressions.
- [ ] A function to try and simplify an expression as much as possible using specific rules.
- [ ] A "standard library" of different rules.
